# ChessFX
> A not so FX chess game written in Java

ChessFX is a chess game written in Java. <br>
It's an extension of a project done during my 2nd year of my computer science degree at [DUT Info Reims](https://iut-info.univ-reims.fr/)

It implements almost every rule of chess : 
- Moves restrictions for each piece
- Check
- Checkmate
- Draw 
- Null game (stalemate, 50-move rule)
- enPassant
- Castle
- Algebraic notation 

### How to play
To play it, download this project and execute the `Main` class. <br>
Once done, everything will be shown in a terminal, just follow the instructions. Both players needs to use the same computer !

### Historic
This project was created for a project for my school. <br>
I decided recently to give it a fresh look and fix some issues.

Original authors are 
- Eric Desjardin
- Jean-Michel Nourrit 

for the base structure of the project (Some part of the class structure and inheritance, `Position.java` structure and `Notation.java` code)
